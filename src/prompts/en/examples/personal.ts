Today I realized something important about my tendency to overthink decisions. While having coffee with Sarah, she mentioned how quickly I shut down the idea of applying for that art workshop. My immediate response was to list all the reasons why it wouldn't work - time, money, my supposed lack of talent.

But sitting here now, I recognize this pattern. It's the same one that kept me from trying photography last year. I'm not afraid of failing as much as I'm afraid of being seen trying. There's a vulnerability in beginning something new, in being a novice.

Maybe this resistance is telling me exactly why I need to do this. I've spent so many years in my comfort zone that it's become less of a comfort and more of a cage.

Question to reflect on: What would I do if I knew no one was watching or judging?`,

The house feels different now that Mom has moved to assisted living. I spent the afternoon going through old photo albums in what used to be her crafting room. Found pictures from that summer vacation in Maine - all of us squeezed into that tiny rental cabin, laughing about Dad's failed attempts at fishing.

The grief comes in waves. Sometimes it's not even sadness, just a hollow feeling when I realize I can't call her for our usual Sunday chats about her garden. The nurses say she's adjusting well, but it's hard to reconcile the vibrant woman in these photos with someone who now struggles to remember my name.

I keep telling myself this is the right decision, but the guilt lingers. Time feels so precious now, and I'm learning that being a good daughter sometimes means making impossible choices.

Gratitude moment: Found a handwritten recipe card in her cookbook - her famous apple pie. Her handwriting is like a time capsule.`,

Spent sunrise at the beach today. No phone, no book, just presence. The sky shifted through so many shades of pink I never knew existed. Watched an elderly couple walking their dog - they moved slowly, in perfect sync, stopping whenever their golden retriever found something interesting to sniff.

I've been rushing through life lately, always three steps ahead of the present moment. But today, for just an hour, time felt different. Noticed how the sand feels different at the water's edge - more compact, cool against my feet. Even my breathing changed, matching the rhythm of the waves.

Been thinking about what my therapist said about "productive" versus "present." Why is it so hard to believe that sometimes just existing, just observing, is enough?

Note to self: The world doesn't stop being beautiful just because I'm too busy to notice it.`,
