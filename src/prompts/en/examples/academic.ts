- Jazz Age social customs
- Class mobility in 1920s

Professor's Emphasis:
* Focus on unreliable narrator perspective
* Parallel between Gatsby's fabrication and nation's self-image
* Importance of time/past in narrative

Essay Topics Discussed:
1. Role of wealth in character relationships
2. Corruption of the American Dream
3. Impact of social class on personal identity`,

Topic: Memory Formation & Retrieval

I. Types of Memory
A. Sensory Memory
   - Duration: < 1 second
   - Examples: visual (iconic), auditory (echoic)
   - Functions as initial filter for attention

B. Short-term Memory (Working Memory)
   - Duration: 20-30 seconds
   - Capacity: 7 ± 2 items
   - Can be extended through chunking

C. Long-term Memory
   - Potentially unlimited capacity
   - Requires consolidation
   - Types: explicit (declarative) vs. implicit (procedural)

Key Study: Peterson & Peterson (1959)
- Demonstrated rapid decay of short-term memory
- Method: Participants remembered trigrams while counting backward
- Results: 90% forgetting after 18 seconds

Questions for exam:
* How does stress affect memory consolidation?
* Difference between retrograde and anterograde amnesia
* Role of hippocampus in memory formation`,

Lab Session: Atmospheric CO2 Analysis
Date: May 8, 2024

Equipment Used:
- Gas chromatograph
- Air sampling containers
- Data logging software
- Temperature probes

Methodology:
1. Collected air samples from 3 locations:
   * Urban center (downtown)
   * Suburban park
   * Industrial zone
2. Measured CO2 concentrations at different times:
   - Morning (7am)
   - Noon
   - Evening (6pm)

Results:
Location      AM    Noon    PM
Downtown     415    422    428
Park         402    408    411
Industrial   425    431    436
(All values in ppm)

Observations:
* Highest concentrations in industrial zone
* All locations show daily variation pattern
* Temperature correlation noted
* Urban heat island effect visible in data

Error Sources:
- Wind direction variations
- Temperature fluctuations
- Equipment calibration
- Human error in collection

Questions for Lab Report:
1. Explain daily CO2 concentration patterns
2. Compare results with global averages
3. Discuss impact of local factors`,
