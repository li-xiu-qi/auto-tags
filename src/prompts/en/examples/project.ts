Sprint retrospective for the API migration project. Team morale is improving after resolving the database bottleneck issues. Key achievements:
- Completed migration of user authentication endpoints
- Reduced latency by 45%
- Implemented new error handling system

Challenges remain with the legacy data transformation. Sarah suggested using a queue system to handle the load, which we'll explore next sprint.

TODO for tomorrow:
- Review PR for data validation
- Schedule architecture review
- Update project timeline`,
